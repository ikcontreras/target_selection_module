## Description

A backend service for the New Republic‚Äôs YVH battle droids. It processes incoming radar data and returns the coordinates of the most appropriate target based on specific tactical protocols.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Framework:** Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Build Tool:** esbuild
- **Runtime Scripts:** tsx

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites: MongoDB and Environment Configuration

Before running the server or executing the tests, ensure the following:

### üõ† MongoDB
- MongoDB must be installed and running locally.
- Default local connection URI used:
    - `mongodb://localhost:27017/yvh-target-selection-module`

### üîë Environment Variables
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
- Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
- Update the `MONGO_CONNECTION` variable in the `.env` file with the correct MongoDB connection URI.
- Update the `PORT` variable in the `.env` file with the desired port number for the server.
- Update the `FORMAT_LOG` variable in the `.env` file with the desired log format for the server.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:
1. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

3. Start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

## üß™ Running the Test Suite

This project includes an official test script to verify the correct behavior of the `/radar` endpoint and the logic behind each protocol.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Ensure `curl` is installed on your system.
- The backend service must be running locally (default port: `8888`).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execute the Tests

Follow these steps to run the official test suite and verify that your `/radar` endpoint behaves correctly.

### 1. Start your server

Make sure your backend service is running locally at:

`http://localhost:8888`

### 2. Execute the tests

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run test
```

This will execute the test suite and verify that your `/radar` endpoint behaves correctly.


## üéØ Supported Protocols

The application provides the following protocol strategies:

- `closest-enemies`: Prioritize the nearest point with enemies.
- `furthest-enemies`: Prioritize the farthest point with enemies.
- `assist-allies`: Prioritize points where allies are present.
- `avoid-crossfire`: Avoid points where allies are present.
- `prioritize-mech`: Prioritize mech-type enemies first.
- `avoid-mech`: Do not attack mech-type enemies.

Multiple compatible protocols can be combined in a single request.

Enemies located more than 100 meters away will be ignored.

## üß© Extending Protocols

The system is designed to be easily extendable with new targeting strategies.

To add a new protocol:

1. Navigate to the `src/protocols` directory.
2. Create a new file that implements the `TargetPrioritizationStrategy` type.
3. Add your new protocol name to the `Protocols` enum in the `src/types/protocols.ts` file.

This allows the system to dynamically evaluate new targeting rules as they are introduced.


## Usage

The application provides a RESTful API for the Advanced Defense Droid YVH to select the best target for a given set of protocols.

### Endpoints

#### POST /radar

This endpoint is used to send the radar data to the application. The radar data is an array of objects, each representing a scanned position.


Example:
```json
{
  "protocols": ["avoid-mech"],
  "scan": [
    {
      "coordinates": {
        "x": 0,
        "y": 40
      },
      "enemies": {
        "type": "soldier",
        "number": 10
      },
      "allies": 5
    },
    {
      "coordinates": {
        "x": 0,
        "y": 80
      },
      "enemies": {
        "type": "mech",
        "number": 1
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Each scanned position has the following properties:
- `protocols`: an array of strings representing the protocols that the radar data is used for.
- `scan`: an array of objects representing the scanned positions.

Each scanned position object has the following properties:
- `coordinates`: an object representing the coordinates of the scanned position.
- `enemies`: an object representing the enemies in the scanned position.

The `enemies` object has the following properties:
- `type`: a string representing the type of enemies in the scanned position. Possible values are:
  - `soldier`: soldiers
  - `mech`: mechs
- `number`: an integer representing the number of enemies in the scanned position.
- `allies`: an optional property representing the number of allies in the scanned position.

The `allies` property is an optional property that represents the number of allies in the scanned position.

This endpoint returns a JSON object with the following properties:
- `x`: an integer representing the x-coordinate of the selected target.
- `y`: an integer representing the y-coordinate of the selected target.

Example:
```json
{
  "x": 0,
  "y": 40
}
```

#### GET /audit

This endpoint is used to retrieve the audit records from the application.

Example:
```json
[
  {
    "target": {

      "y": 40
    },
    "_id": "67fc1b20b6a2e35a8aaab684",

      },
      {
        "coordinates": {
          "x": 0,
          "y": 80
        },
        "allies": 5,
        "enemies": {
          "type": "mech",
          "number": 1
        }
      }

# Audit Scripts for Local API

These scripts interact with a local API running at `http://localhost:8888`. Make sure the server is up before executing them.


### 1. `audit_all.sh`
Fetches all registered audit entries.

```bash
./scripts/audit_all.sh
```

### 2. `audit_by_id.sh`
Fetches a specific audit entry by its ID.

```bash
./scripts/audit_by_id.sh <audit_id>
```

### 3. `delete_audit.sh`
Deletes a specific audit entry by its ID.

```bash
./scripts/delete_audit.sh <audit_id>
```
